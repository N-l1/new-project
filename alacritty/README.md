# Alacritty ðŸ’¨

is [**awesome**](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty). Its even better with customizations:

- Light [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code) font
- Underline cursor \_
- Semi-transparent background
- Hmm, that's it ðŸ¤”

Three separate files here. One for Mac and the other two for Windows. 
The WSL file is to link to the actual Alacritty Windows config file, and the Windows file is to store the Windows config. 
It would be great if I can just link the Windows config file on WSL with the actual file, but that doesn't seem to want to work. 
Right now, I guess I'll have to keep both files in sync by copying...
